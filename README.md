# Dijkstra's Algorithm with Python

## What is it?

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for
example, road networks. It was conceived by the Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three
years later. The algorithm exists in many variants.

## What about this repo?

Long story short, I had to solve this problem of the Data Structure discipline of my college, and my way to make it more
interesting was to search and implement this algorithm. I chose Python to implement it because it was pretty
straightforward :p.

It is a basic implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm, and I did my best to make the variable names and logic more
understandable. The starting point is Philadelphia, and the goal is Fort Wayne.

The base graph used in the example can be seen below:

I hope you find this repository useful, although there are many others just like this one, and in other programming
languages too! Thanks for reading!
